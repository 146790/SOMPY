SOMPY
=====

A Python Library for Self Organizing Map (SOM)

As much as possible, the structure of SOM is similar to somtoolbox in Matlab. It has the following functionalities:

1- Only Batch training, which is faster than online training. It has parallel processing option similar to sklearn format and it might speed up the training procedure, but it depends on the data size and mainly the size of the SOM grid.I couldn't manage the memory problem and therefore, I recommend single core processing at the moment.
2- PCA (or RandomPCA (default)) initialization, using sklearn or random initialization
3- component plane visualization (different modes)
4- Hitmap
3- 1-d or 2-d SOM with only rectangular, planar grid. (works well in comparison with hexagonal shape, when I was checking in Matlab with somtoolbox)
4- different methods for function approximation and predictions (mostly using Sklearn)
